# GCNGDE_Simulation_for_EEG_analysis
Analyzing EGG dataset using graph convolutional neural network and graph neural ODE. Achieved 15%-20% improvement on brain state identification for epilepsy patients than the [baseline paper][1]. The work is the foundation for implementing the brain graph learning and brain state identification system on chip.
